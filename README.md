# mc-exercise: How could these problems have been prevented?

Review the workflow on Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice and try to identify all of the individual things that they did wrong AND all of the things that they should have done but failed to do. Write up descriptions of those things and put those into the README of the repo.

## Ted: Both Ted and Alice should have done a git pull origin main in Step 3.

## Alice: Both Ted and Alice should have done a git pull origin main in Step 3.

## Bob: In Step 1 Bob should have done a git pull origin main before making changes. After switching teams, Bob and Alice should have made their changes on a branch instead of main.

## Carol: After switching teams, Ted and Carol should have been on another feature branch instead of the main branch.
